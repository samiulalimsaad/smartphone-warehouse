            <p>
                MongoDB and NodeJS are two different technologies. MongoDB is a
                database system which gives a chance to efficiently store
                documents in a database. On the other hand javascript is a
                programming Language.

            <p>To backend development we will use Javascript.</p>
            <p>To Store, Read, write, update, delete we will use MongoDB.</p>
